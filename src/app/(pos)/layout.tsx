 * the till's own nav is three items long, none of them `/admin`, and the sidebar in
 * here is the only navigation there is. Leaving the area was a URL somebody had to
 * know.
 *
 * Administrators only. An employee who tapped this would be sent to `/login` by
 * `requireShellUser(['admin'])` — a nav item that logs a cashier out is worse than
 * a nav item that is not there.
