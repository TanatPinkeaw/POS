/**
 * The privacy notices at `/privacy` and `/privacy/staff`.
 *
 * **Why this test reads the source instead of rendering the pages.** The defect it
 * exists to catch is a disclosure going to the wrong reader, and rendering would only
 * prove the page still renders. What matters is *which sentences are in which file* —
 * so the source is the thing under test, the same way `offline-shell.test.ts` reads the
 * shipped `public/sw.js` rather than a twin of it.
 *
 * **The defect.** The first draft carried one line in the customer notice:
 *
 *     <li>ข้อมูลการเข้า–ออกงาน เฉพาะกรณีที่คุณเป็นพนักงานของร้าน</li>
 *
 * Attendance records, inside a list of purchase history. Every customer standing at
 * the counter was told the shop keeps a clock on its own employees: a disclosure about
 * somebody else's data, made in the one document that customer is entitled to read, to
 * the wrong person. Attendance is the most personal record this system holds, because
 * it measures a person's day. The schema cannot prevent the confusion — `users` is one
 * table, and a person can be a member and a cashier in the same row — so the split has
 * to be asserted here instead.

/**

 * the very phrases the assertions below forbid — the customer page names attendance
 * records in the comment recording that it used to list them, and would name them in
 * the comment recording that it must not. Asserting against the raw source would make
 * the documentation of a fix read as the fix's violation of it, which is how a guard
 * like this quietly gets deleted rather than obeyed.
 *
 * A regex rather than a parser, because the repository is one-sided: these two files
 * have no block comment inside a string, and a stripper that lost its mind on the copy
 * would fail the very assertions it exists to make.
